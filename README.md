# Movie Store

This app contains sample structure and logic to retrieve data from OMDb.

Libraries used:
- mui5
- standardjs
- jest
- react router

The demo contains only partial solution without some fine tuned styling.
I know it can be fine tuned but I'm already over my timebox.

Enhancements which I consider as next steps:
- finalize login logic
- use typescript: I'm not yet experienced with it so I did not add it to this sample
- add unit tests: Currently I have low experience with UT in React (does not mean no experience with UT in other languages)
- docker deployment: this is where I have experience, but not done due to timebox expiration
